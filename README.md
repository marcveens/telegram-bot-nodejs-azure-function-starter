# telegram-bot-nodejs-azure-function-starter

Yes, that's really what it is. A Telegram bot using Node.js hosted as an Azure Function App. 

The stack that's used by this starter: 
- [telegraf.js](https://telegraf.js.org/) - Node.js Telegram bot
- Typescript - type safety
- [Azure Function App](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) - as a host for your bot
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - building and deploying to Azure

This started provides a mode for developing your bot on your local machine as well as a mode for running in production. The difference is that the production mode works using a Telegram webhook while the development mode uses the default Telegram long polling mechanism. This way there's no hassle using tunneling software like ngrok. 

# Setting up the bot
## Step 1: Preparing the code
Let's start easy, fork/clone this repository. This repo provides all code to create a bot that only knows a `Hello Word` command. Good enough to start with! 

In the root of this repository you see a `.env.example` file. Rename this file to `.env`. This is where your secret Telegram bot token will be stored on your local machine. For now leave the value as is, we will replace it with the real value later on. 

## Step 2: Create an Azure Function App
<img src="/docs/create-function-app.jpg" alt="Create Azure Function App" align="right" width="400" />

First step is creating a Node.js Azure Function App. You can run through the default setup with all the settings you like. The only thing I advice is running it on __Windows__ OS. This might seem unnecessary but I found Windows Azure Function Apps to run Timer triggers more consistent than on a Linux OS. 

When asked for a plan type, select __Consumption (Serverless)__. By default Apps running on a Consumption plan will timeout after a maximum 10 minutes of inactivity, but we will use a Timer trigger Function App to fix that. This Timer trigger is a second Function that is deployed, which is set up to trigger every 10 minutes. This will make sure the bot never gets a timeout without using a more expensive plan type, pretty awesome!

After creating your Node.js Azure Function App, go to the Function App resource and download the __publish profile__. We will need that later when configuring our automatic deployment.

Next thing we will have to configure is our `AzureWebJobsStorage` connection string. While creating your Azure Function App, you also had to configure a __Storage account__. Navigate to that storage account in the Azure portal. Next go to the __Access keys__ menu item, click __Show keys__ and copy either one of the Connection strings. Now paste that connection string in the `AzureWebJobsStorage` field in `local.settings.json`. 

## Step 3: Registering the bot
In order to register your Telegram bot you need to talk to the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) on Telegram. 

<img src="/docs/botfather.jpg" alt="BotFather" align="center" width="600" />

By typing `/newbot` your new bot will be registered. The __name__ that you enter is displayed in contact details and elsewhere. The __Username__ as a short name, to be used in mentions an t.me links. This name __must__ end in 'bot', e.g. 'tetris_bot' or 'TetrisBot'.

When done registering the bot you'll get a token to access the HTTP API. 

<img src="/docs/botfather-done.jpg" alt="BotFather" align="center" width="600" />

This access token is what should be placed as a value of the `BOT_TOKEN` key in your `.env` file in the root of this project. Next to that, the `BOT_TOKEN` should also be registered as an Application setting in your Function App configuration.

<img src="/docs/bot-token-configuration-azure.jpg" alt="Azure Application settings" align="center" width="600" />

While in the Application Settings window we should also add a `WEBHOOK_ADDRESS` setting. The value should be the Function App URL like so: https://{your-function-name}.azurewebsites.net/api/bot.

Don't forget to press __save__ after adding the settings!

The bot is now almost ready!

## Step 4: Deployment 
Within the project I used a GitHub Action to build and deploy the code to the Azure Function App. In order to run it properly we need to adjust 2 settings.

1. In `.github/workflows/main.yml` we need to set the `AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME` variable. This should be the name of your __Azure Function App__.
2. On GitHub go to your repository Settings page, and navigate to the Secrets tab: 
    <img src="/docs/github-actions-secrets.jpg" alt="GitHub Secrets" align="center" />
    Create a secret with `AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE` as the name, and the content of the __publish-profile__ file we downloaded earlier. Just copy/paste the entire content into the Value field. This publish profile will make sure the GitHub Action deploys the code to the correct Azure Function App.

If everything is configured correctly a GitHub Action should now run after every commit to your repository. It automatically deploys your code to the Azure Function App, so all you have to do is push changes to your repository to update the bot! 

All the setup should be done by now, let's test the bot!

# Testing the bot
Exciting, the bot should be up and running by now! Let's find the bot on Telegram (BotFather sent your the t.me link to your bot in the same message as the access token) and try sending it a `/hello` command. If everything went well you should get a response as follows:

<img src="/docs/bot-response.jpg" alt="Bot response" align="center" width="600" />

Hooray, you setup your own Telegram bot! 

The only command I configured is `/hello` which you can find in `/bot/commands/botCommands.ts`. For all the bot commands documentation, see [telegraf.js](https://telegraf.js.org/). 

# Local development 
A part that's forgotten about most of the time, but the bot must be developed on a local machine. I read a lot of blog posts which want you to tunnel your local environment to a public URL so you can use it as a webhook. Nonsense if you ask me. I modified the code so that the default Telegram long polling mechanism is used on your machine. Simply run `npm run watch` to transpile the TS files to JS files and run `npm start` to start the Function. 

When the Function starts, you see that the bot is available at `http://localhost:7071/api/bot`. Simply open that page in your browser and keep it open. Now you can change the TS files and immediately test the result on Telegram. 

My final tip is to create a separate bot for production and for development. This way you can develop and test a bot and keep your production bot running safely. Simply request a new token using `/newbot` at the BotFather and store that token in your `.env` file. The `.env` file won't be deployed to the Azure Function App so will only be used for local development. 

# It's a wrap
That's it! Please let me know what you're going to use the bot for. If you ran out of ideas, check out  [What can I do with bots?](https://core.telegram.org/bots#1-what-can-i-do-with-bots) to see what Telegram supports. 

Happy coding!
